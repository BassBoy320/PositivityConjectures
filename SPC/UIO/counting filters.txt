filter: k conditions, to be count it has to satisfy one of them. 
A condition is requiring some entries to have specific values


Predictions = []
for correp in X:
	if filter(correp):
		counts = X[correps]
		for UIOID in counts:
			Predictions[UIOID] += counts[UIOID]
			
Alternative:
filteredcorreps
for UIOID in range(uio_n):
	counts = X[UIOID]
	for correp in counts:
		if correp in filteredcorreps:
			Predictions[UIOID] += counts[correp]
			
			
			
n : number of UIOS
m : number of distinct core reps
q : quotient of how many correps the average UIOS has
p : quotient how many UIOs the average correp has

m * p * q

n * q * m
